# Elevate
Podcast website that focuses on personal/professional development, and is Simon Sinek's landing page.

Elevate is a new podcast site, that has podcast specifically focusing on self-improvement. They are already on all major platforms but decided that they wanted a website as well, so that people could listen to their favorite podcast on a computer while doing other work without need a mobile device. Our team was tasked to come up with the landing page for Simon Sinek. We approached this by having a splash image of Simon Sinek and with that image, their most recent episode that was uploaded to the Elevate podcast. Then we created another section where you could find all the other episode that Simon Sinek was apart of.
